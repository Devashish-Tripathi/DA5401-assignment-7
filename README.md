# DA5401: Assignment 7

Submitted by: **Devashish Tripathi**

Roll Number: **DA25C006**

Public repository for the Assignment 7 for the course DA5401.

Assignment is contained in the [DA5401_Assignment7_DA25C006.ipynb](DA5401_Assignment7_DA25C006.ipynb) file. All sections have been run. 
In case rerun is to be done, you can get the UCI Landsat Satellite dataset from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/146/statlog+landsat+satellite). 
Download the zip file and unzip it in the same folder as the notebook. 

The libraries needed are provided in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). The code runs in a jupyter environment.

I have used *italics* in the markdown wherever I have stated some observation or fact, to distinguish it from the rest of the markdown text.

Thank you :)
